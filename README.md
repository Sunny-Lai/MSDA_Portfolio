A Portfolio of my projects towards completion in a Masters of Science in Data Analytics 


## KNN Classification Project
### Objective
The goal of this analysis is to utilize k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to identify what factors most significantly relate to patients within a medical database being readmitted within 30 days. The variables that will be analyzed are within a dataset provided by the University.
### Technology Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Importing Packages, Labraries and Dataset
- Detecting for duplicates, missing values, and outliers
- Data Wrangling (transforming categorical values to numerical with dummy variables)
- Exploratory Data Analysis
### Analysis
- Scaling Data
- Feature Selection
- Splitting and training the data
- Determining K
- Classification model, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve
### Results
The accuracy scores that resulted provide confidence in our ROC KNN classification model. With a precision score of 98 percent, the model shows it can accurately predict if a patient is readmitted within 30 days of discharge 98 percent of the time with the predictor variables provided. The accuracy scores that resulted from indicates this model as a strong classifier of data that can produce accurate resuts based on our input variables with confidence.
